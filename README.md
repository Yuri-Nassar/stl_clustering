I recommend to create a new enviroment to use this project.

conda create -n 'env_name' python=3.9

The required packages for this procject are available in requirement.txt file.
You can install them using this command:

pip install -r requirment.txt

After that you just need to clone the repo.

git clone https://github.com/Yuri-Nassar/stl_clustering.git
